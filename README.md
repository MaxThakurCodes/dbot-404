  Hey, this is a discord bot called "404 bot" I open sourced the code because I felt like I stopped using discord bots as a     source of income!
  ## How to use this
   Download the latest version bot from [here](https://github.com/maxistheadmin/dbot-404/releases).                           
   Unzip it then make sure you have npm & node installed then run `npm install`.                                               
   Put your token in config.json, and define your prefix also in there.                                                       
   Finally, run `node app.js` and voila there it should be running!.
